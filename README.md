# Diabetes Hospital Readmission Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes hospital readmission rates for diabetic patients using data from 130 US hospitals. The goal is to identify risk factors contributing to readmission and develop predictive models to support healthcare quality improvement and reduce unnecessary readmissions.

## Tools & Techniques

- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- SQL
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset

- Dataset Source: Kaggle
