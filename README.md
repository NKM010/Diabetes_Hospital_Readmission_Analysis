# Diabetes Patient Readmission Prediction
## Project Overview

This project analyzes diabetes patient data to predict hospital readmission rates, identify key risk factors, and support better patient care decisions. The goal is to use data analysis techniques and predictive modeling to help healthcare teams reduce unnecessary readmissions and improve patient outcomes.

## Tools & Techniques

- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- SQL
- Power BI (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset

- Source: Kaggle — Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999–2008  
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/diabetes-patient-readmission-prediction)

## Project Tasks

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Predictive modeling: classification models to predict readmission
- Risk factor analysis
- Visualization of key findings

## Goal

Support healthcare quality improvement initiatives by identifying patients at higher risk of readmission, allowing care teams to plan better interventions.
